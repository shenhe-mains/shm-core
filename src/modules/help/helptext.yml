    automod:
        title: Automoderator Help
        body: >
            The automoderator scans all new messages in this server. Messages sent by bots and certain staff members will not be scanned to allow mods to explain
            why certain words are bad without needing to dodge the censor; however, they are held to higher standards than regular users and may be demoted for
            offences rather than just warned or muted for a few days.


            You can view a list of automod terms [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15nupMHv84-Si2OLYaBwD3KTjHlI169JjRN5JZjLkIyA/edit?usp=sharing).
            To request for automod terms to be added, removed, or changed, please visit <#805458033471782974>, or, if you are a staff member, you may just mention
            it in <#840864247373103114>.


            Commands in this module: `automod-add`, `automod-rm`, `automod-scan`, `automod-list`
    automod-add:
        title: Automoderator - Add term
        body: >
            `{prefix}automod-add <type> <action> <term to match>`


            Adds a new term to the automoderator. `type` should be one of `substring` (match anywhere), `word` (match regular expression only when surrounded by
            non-letters), or `regex` (match regular expression). `action` should be one of `defer` (alert mod chat), `delete` (silently remove the message), `verbal`
            (send a verbal/unlogged warning), `warn` (send a formal warning), `mute` (mute the user indefinitely and alert mod chat), `kick` (temporarily kick the
            user from the server), or `ban` (ban the user indefinitely and alert mod chat).


            Please only use `word` or `regex` if you know what you're doing with regular expressions. You can request for terms to be added in <#805458033471782974>
            or <#840864247373103114>.

    automod-rm:
        title: Automoderator - Remove term
        body: >
            `{prefix}automod-rm <term to match>`


            Remove a term from the automoderator. You must enter the exact string being matched by the automoderator. You can run `{prefix}automod-list` to find the
            string if you forget what it is.


            You can request for terms to be removed in <#805458033471782974> or <#840864247373103114>.
        footer: Requires Owner / Admin / Developer
    automod-scan:
        title: Automoderator - Scan message
        body: >
            `{prefix}automod-scan <message content>`


            Scan a message. This command can be used by anyone but it is recommended to only use it as a moderator because if the scan succeeds, the automoderator
            will trigger and take action against you.
    automod-list:
        title: Automod - List terms
        body: >
            `{prefix}automod-list`


            List all terms currently matched by the automoderator. Due to the nature of the automod, this will contain inappropriate, offensive, and potentially
            triggering terms, and as such, it is restricted. Please only use this in private channels or where you are sure it will not be hurtful to anyone.

    customroles:
        title: Custom Supporter Roles
        body: >
            Server boosters and [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/shenhe) supporters, on top of receiving the exclusive roles <@&817617933495697469> and
            <@&926279568980058183> respectively, also gain access to custom roles. To get your role, head over to <#805458034251530262> and run
            `{prefix}role-claim <role name>`. Then, you can rename it with `{prefix}role-rename <role name>` or change its color with `{prefix}role-color <color>`.


            Server boosters' roles will be removed when they are no longer boosting the server, but the ko-fi supporter role, and therefore the custom roles, are
            permanent.
    role-claim:
        title: Custom Role - Claim
        body: >
            `{prefix}role-claim <role name>`


            Claim a role with a particular name. You will be granted this role and it will be attached to your account so long as you are a server supporter. If
            your custom role already exists, this does the same thing as `{prefix}role-rename`.
    role-rename:
        title: Custom Role - Rename
        body: >
            `{prefix}role-rename <role name>`


            Rename your custom role. If your role does not exist yet, this does the same thing as `{prefix}role-claim`.
    role-color:
        title: Custom Role - Recolor
        body: >
            `{prefix}role-color <role name>`


            Recolor your custom role. You can enter a hexcode or some common color names such as `red`, `blue`, etc. If you're having trouble with this, you can
            pick a color with [this online color picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/color-code/d9e9f9) and copy-paste the code (`#` followed by 6 characters).
            If your role does not exist yet, it gets created with the name `new role`.

    db:
        title: Database Query
        body: >
            `{prefix}db <query>`


            Query the database. Please only do this if you know what you're doing. The server is running PostgreSQL with the `pg` node module.

    fun:
        title: Fun / Miscellaneous Commands
        body: >
            This is a collection of random non-utility commands.


            Commands in this module: `choose`
    choose:
        title: Choose Random Option
        body: >
            `{prefix}choose <option> <option> <option>` / `{prefix}choose <option with spaces>, <option with spaces>, <etc.>`


            Pick a random option. For example, `{prefix}choose head tails` to flip a coin.
    help:
        title: Help
        body: >
            This is the command you are using right now. `{prefix}help` to see the list of modules, or `{prefix}help <key>` if you have something in particular
            that you need help with.
    messagelogs:
        title: Message Logging
        body: >
            Messages that are edited or deleted are logged to <#922671895495733278> for moderation purposes.
    moderation:
        title: Moderation
        body: >
            This module contains all of the standard moderation utilities - muting, banning, etc.


            Commands in this module: `slowmode`, `verbal`, `warn`, `mute`, `kick`, `ban`, `unmute`, `unban`, `massban`, `remove`, `clear-history`, `history`
    slowmode:
        title: Slowmode
        body: >
            `{prefix}slowmode [channel] <duration> [reason]`


            Set the slowmode for a channel (default: current channel) with a particular reason (optional). Set the duration to `0` to remove the slowmode.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    verbal:
        title: Verbally Warn
        body: >
            `{prefix}verbal <user> <reason>`


            Verbally (informally) warn a user. This does not leave any records on their history. Generally, DMing the user directly is better. Also consider
            opening a modmail thread with the user if you have a non-warning inquiry (`{prefix}modmail <user>`). This command will prompt for confirmation.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    warn:
        title: Warn
        body: >
            `{prefix}warn <user> <reason>`


            Warn a user, which is logged to their history. This command will prompt for confirmation. `{prefix}warn-silent` will not DM the user (useful for
            adding a note to a user).
        footer: Requires Moderator
    mute:
        title: Mute
        body: >
            `{prefix}mute <user> [duration] [reason]`


            Mute a user for the specified duration (default 0 = indefinitely), which disables their ability to send messages, add reactions, and connect to
            voice calls. This command will prompt for confirmation. `{prefix}mute-silent` will not DM the user.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    kick:
        title: Kick
        body: >
            `{prefix}kick <user> [reason]`


            Kicks a user for the specified reason. This command will prompt for confirmation. `{prefix}kick-silent` will not DM the user.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    ban:
        title: Ban
        body: >
            `{prefix}ban <user> [duration] [reason]`


            Bans a user for the specified duration (default 0 = indefinitely). This command will prompt for confirmation. `{prefix}ban-silent` will not DM the user.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    unmute:
        title: Unmute
        body: >
            `{prefix}unmute <user> [reason]`


            Unmutes a user, restoring their ability to send messages, add reactions, and connect to voice calls. This command will **not** prompt for confirmation.
            `{prefix}unmute-silent` will not DM the user.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    unban:
        title: Unban
        body: >
            `{prefix}unban <user> [reason]`

            Unbans a user. This command will **not** prompt for confirmation. If the user is not banned, this command will fail. Because users who do not share a
            server with a bot cannot be DM'd, this commmand will never attempt to DM the user. You should DM them yourself if you feel that it is necessary.
