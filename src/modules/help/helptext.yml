    automod:
        title: Automoderator Help
        body: >
            The automoderator scans all new messages in this server. Messages sent by bots and certain staff members will not be scanned to allow mods to explain
            why certain words are bad without needing to dodge the censor; however, they are held to higher standards than regular users and may be demoted for
            offences rather than just warned or muted for a few days.


            You can view a list of automod terms [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15nupMHv84-Si2OLYaBwD3KTjHlI169JjRN5JZjLkIyA/edit?usp=sharing).
            To request for automod terms to be added, removed, or changed, please visit <#805458033471782974>, or, if you are a staff member, you may just mention
            it in <#840864247373103114>.


            Commands in this module: `automod-add`, `automod-rm`, `automod-scan`, `automod-list`
    automod-add:
        title: Automoderator - Add term
        body: |
            `{prefix}automod-add <type> <action> term to match`

            Adds a new term to the automoderator. `type` should be one of `substring` (match anywhere), `word` (match regular expression only when surrounded by
            non-letters), or `regex` (match regular expression). `action` should be one of `defer` (alert mod chat), `delete` (silently remove the message), `verbal`
            (send a verbal/unlogged warning), `warn` (send a formal warning), `mute` (mute the user indefinitely and alert mod chat), `kick` (temporarily kick the
            user from the server), or `ban` (ban the user indefinitely and alert mod chat).

            Please only use `word` or `regex` if you know what you're doing with regular expressions. You can request for terms to be added in <#805458033471782974>
            or <#840864247373103114>.
