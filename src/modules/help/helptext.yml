            The bot's prefix is `{prefix}`.
            You can get help for a particular module using `{prefix}help <module>`. The following modules exist:

            `automod` - Automoderation features (banned words, spam detection, etc.)
            `customroles` - Custom roles for server supporters
            `help` - This module
            `messagelogs` - Logging for message edits / deletions
            `moderation` - Mod commands (muting, banning, etc.)
            `nukeguard` - Anti-nuking features
            `polls` - Poll-related commands
            `settings` - Bot settings
            `statschannels` - Server stats channels like member count and boosters
            `utility` - Utility and info commands like user info
            `verification` - Captcha verification system
            `website` - https://shenhemains.com
            `welcome` - Welcome messages for new users

            Alternatively, if you have a specific command you want help for, you can run `{prefix}help <command>` (don't include the prefix in the command name).
    automod:
        title: Automoderator Help
        body: >
            The automoderator scans all new messages in this server. Messages sent by bots and certain staff members will not be scanned to allow mods to explain
            why certain words are bad without needing to dodge the censor; however, they are held to higher standards than regular users and may be demoted for
            offences rather than just warned or muted for a few days.


            To request for automod terms to be added, removed, or changed, please visit <#805458033471782974>, or, if you are a staff member, you may just mention
            it in <#840864247373103114>.


            To view a list of banned terms, you can run `{prefix}help automod-terms`. Sensitive or offensive words will be spoilered and most terms will be explained
            without mentioning the term itself if possible.
