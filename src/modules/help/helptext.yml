        title: Shenhe Bot Help
        body: |
            The bot's prefix is `{prefix}`.
            You can get help for a particular module using `{prefix}help <module>`. The following modules exist:

            `automod` - Automoderation features (banned words, spam detection, etc.)
            `customroles` - Custom roles for server supporters
            `db` - Database commands
            `fun` - Fun / miscellaneous commands
            `help` - This module
            `messagelogs` - Logging for message edits / deletions
            `moderation` - Mod commands (muting, banning, etc.)
            `modmail` - Modmail / Ticket system
            `nukeguard` - Anti-nuking features
            `polls` - Poll-related commands
            `settings` - Bot settings
            `statschannels` - Server stats channels like member count and boosters
            `sticky` - Sticky messages
            `triggers` - Autoresponder triggers
            `utility` - Utility and info commands like user info
            `verification` - CAPTCHA verification system
            `website` - https://shenhemains.com
            `welcome` - Welcome messages for new users

            Additionally, there is a module handler (`modulehandler`) that is not itself a module because it is responsible for interfacing between the bot and modules.

            Alternatively, if you have a specific command you want help for, you can run `{prefix}help <command>` (don't include the prefix in the command name).
    automod:
        title: Automoderator Help
        body: >
            The automoderator scans all new messages in this server. Messages sent by bots and certain staff members will not be scanned to allow mods to explain
            why certain words are bad without needing to dodge the censor; however, they are held to higher standards than regular users and may be demoted for
            offences rather than just warned or muted for a few days.


            You can view a list of automod terms [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15nupMHv84-Si2OLYaBwD3KTjHlI169JjRN5JZjLkIyA/edit?usp=sharing).
            To request for automod terms to be added, removed, or changed, please visit <#805458033471782974>, or, if you are a staff member, you may just mention
            it in <#840864247373103114>.


            Commands in this module: `automod-add`, `automod-rm`, `automod-scan`, `automod-list`
    automod-add:
        title: Automoderator - Add term
        body: >
            `{prefix}automod-add <type> <action> <term to match>`


            Adds a new term to the automoderator. `type` should be one of `substring` (match anywhere), `word` (match regular expression only when surrounded by
            non-letters), or `regex` (match regular expression). `action` should be one of `defer` (alert mod chat), `delete` (silently remove the message), `verbal`
            (send a verbal/unlogged warning), `warn` (send a formal warning), `mute` (mute the user indefinitely and alert mod chat), `kick` (temporarily kick the
            user from the server), or `ban` (ban the user indefinitely and alert mod chat).


            Please only use `word` or `regex` if you know what you're doing with regular expressions. You can request for terms to be added in <#805458033471782974>
            or <#840864247373103114>.

    automod-rm:
        title: Automoderator - Remove term
        body: >
            `{prefix}automod-rm <term to match>`


            Remove a term from the automoderator. You must enter the exact string being matched by the automoderator. You can run `{prefix}automod-list` to find the
            string if you forget what it is.


            You can request for terms to be removed in <#805458033471782974> or <#840864247373103114>.
        footer: Requires Bot Owner / Admin / Developer
    automod-scan:
        title: Automoderator - Scan message
        body: >
            `{prefix}automod-scan <message content>`


            Scan a message. This command can be used by anyone but it is recommended to only use it as a moderator because if the scan succeeds, the automoderator
            will trigger and take action against you.
    automod-list:
        title: Automod - List terms
        body: >
            `{prefix}automod-list`


            List all terms currently matched by the automoderator. Due to the nature of the automod, this will contain inappropriate, offensive, and potentially
            triggering terms, and as such, it is restricted. Please only use this in private channels or where you are sure it will not be hurtful to anyone.
        footer: Requires Bot Owner / Admin / Developer
    customroles:
        title: Custom Supporter Roles
        body: >
            Server boosters and [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/shenhe) supporters, on top of receiving the exclusive roles <@&817617933495697469> and
            <@&926279568980058183> respectively, also gain access to custom roles. To get your role, head over to <#805458034251530262> and run
            `{prefix}role-claim <role name>`. Then, you can rename it with `{prefix}role-rename <role name>` or change its color with `{prefix}role-color <color>`.


            Server boosters' roles will be removed when they are no longer boosting the server, but the ko-fi supporter role, and therefore the custom roles, are
            permanent.
    role-claim:
        title: Custom Role - Claim
        body: >
            `{prefix}role-claim <role name>`


            Claim a role with a particular name. You will be granted this role and it will be attached to your account so long as you are a server supporter. If
            your custom role already exists, this does the same thing as `{prefix}role-rename`.
    role-rename:
        title: Custom Role - Rename
        body: >
            `{prefix}role-rename <role name>`


            Rename your custom role. If your role does not exist yet, this does the same thing as `{prefix}role-claim`.
    role-color:
        title: Custom Role - Recolor
        body: >
            `{prefix}role-color <role name>`


            Recolor your custom role. You can enter a hexcode or some common color names such as `red`, `blue`, etc. If you're having trouble with this, you can
            pick a color with [this online color picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/color-code/d9e9f9) and copy-paste the code (`#` followed by 6 characters).
            If your role does not exist yet, it gets created with the name `new role`.
        footer: A.K.A. role-colour
    db:
        title: Database Query
        body: >
            `{prefix}db <query>`


            Query the database. Please only do this if you know what you're doing. The server is running PostgreSQL with the `pg` node module.
        footer: Requires Developer
    fun:
        title: Fun / Miscellaneous Commands
        body: >
            This is a collection of random non-utility commands.


            Commands in this module: `choose`
    choose:
        title: Choose Random Option
        body: >
            `{prefix}choose <option> <option> <option>` / `{prefix}choose <option with spaces>, <option with spaces>, <etc.>`


            Pick a random option. For example, `{prefix}choose head tails` to flip a coin.
    help:
        title: Help
        body: >
            This is the command you are using right now. `{prefix}help` to see the list of modules, or `{prefix}help <key>` if you have something in particular
            that you need help with.
    messagelogs:
        title: Message Logging
        body: >
            Messages that are edited or deleted are logged to <#922671895495733278> for moderation purposes.
    moderation:
        title: Moderation
        body: >
            This module contains all of the standard moderation utilities - muting, banning, etc.


            Commands in this module: `slowmode`, `verbal`, `warn`, `mute`, `kick`, `ban`, `unmute`, `unban`, `massban`, `massban-from-url`, `remove`,
            `clear-history`, `history`
    slowmode:
        title: Slowmode
        body: >
            `{prefix}slowmode [channel] <duration> [reason]`


            Set the slowmode for a channel (default: current channel) with a particular reason (optional). Set the duration to `0` to remove the slowmode.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    verbal:
        title: Verbally Warn
        body: >
            `{prefix}verbal <user> <reason>`


            Verbally (informally) warn a user. This does not leave any records on their history. Generally, DMing the user directly is better. Also consider
            opening a modmail thread with the user if you have a non-warning inquiry (`{prefix}modmail <user>`). This command will prompt for confirmation.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    warn:
        title: Warn
        body: >
            `{prefix}warn <user> <reason>`


            Warn a user, which is logged to their history. This command will prompt for confirmation. `{prefix}warn-silent` will not DM the user (useful for
            adding a note to a user).
        footer: Requires Moderator
    mute:
        title: Mute
        body: >
            `{prefix}mute <user> [duration] [reason]`


            Mute a user for the specified duration (default 0 = indefinitely), which disables their ability to send messages, add reactions, and connect to
            voice calls. This command will prompt for confirmation. `{prefix}mute-silent` will not DM the user.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    kick:
        title: Kick
        body: >
            `{prefix}kick <user> [reason]`


            Kicks a user for the specified reason. This command will prompt for confirmation. `{prefix}kick-silent` will not DM the user.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    ban:
        title: Ban
        body: >
            `{prefix}ban <user> [duration] [reason]`


            Bans a user for the specified duration (default 0 = indefinitely). This command will prompt for confirmation. `{prefix}ban-silent` will not DM the user.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    unmute:
        title: Unmute
        body: >
            `{prefix}unmute <user> [reason]`


            Unmutes a user, restoring their ability to send messages, add reactions, and connect to voice calls. `{prefix}unmute-silent` will not DM the user.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    unban:
        title: Unban
        body: >
            `{prefix}unban <user> [reason]`


            Unbans a user. If the user is not banned, this command will fail. Because users who do not share a server with a bot cannot be DM'd, this commmand
            will never attempt to DM the user. You should DM them yourself if you feel that it is necessary.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    massban:
        title: Massban
        body: >
            `{prefix}massban <user> <user> ... [reason]` / `{prefix}massban-from-url <url> [reason]`


            Massbans many users. This command will prompt for confirmation including the number of users that will be banned and the reason. This command will not DM
            any of the users who are banned. If you need to massban a lot of users and cannot fit it in one message, consider uploading it to something like
            [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Make sure the URL you link is raw plaintext, otherwise it will not be able to parse the user IDs.
        footer: Requires Admin
    remove:
        title: Remove from Records
        body: >
            `{prefix}remove <type> <id>`


            Remove an item from user history by a specific ID. `type` must be one of `warn`, `mute`, `kick`, or `ban`. Note that this command does not fail if the ID
            was not found or is invalid.
        footer: Requires Admin
    clear-history:
        title: Clear User History
        body: >
            `{prefix}clear-history <user> [type]`


            Remove all items from a user's history. `type` must be one of `warns`, `mutes`, `kicks`, or `bans`. If `type` is not specified, this will remove all of a
            user's history.
        footer: Requires Admin
    history:
        title: View User History
        body: >
            `{prefix}history <user> [types...]`


            Show a user's history. `type` arguments must be each one of `warns`, `mutes`, `kicks`, or `bans`. If no types are specified, this will list a user's entire
            history.
    modmail:
        title: Modmail / Ticket System
        body: >
            The modmail system provides a way for users to communicate with the server's staff and vice versa. To contact the staff, simply DM the bot. It will prompt
            you for confirmation that you actually want to open a modmail thread, and once you do, a channel will be created for the moderators where they can interact
            with you. Messages they send to you will be sent to your DMs and your DMs will continue to be forwarded to the channel until the thread is closed. Please
            only use modmail for serious inquiries that require staff attention.


            Modmail threads are logged to <#911071731265986560> when they are opened or closed, and can be viewed on the website via the staff dashboard. You can open
            a modmail thread with a user using `{prefix}modmali <user>`, which creates the modmail channel if it does not already exist. The user will not be notified of
            this. To reply, use `{prefix}reply <message>` or `{prefix}anonreply <message>`. To close the thread, you can do `{prefix}close` or `{prefix}silentclose` to
            not DM the user that the thread has been closed. Deleting the channel is not preferred, but will also silently close the thread.
        footer: Requires Moderator to access modmail from the staff side
    nukeguard:
        title: Anti-Nuking System
        body: >
            This server has some systems in place to prevent nuking (when moderators / admins turn on a server and do massive and irreparable damage to it, sometimes
            requiring it to essentially be completely remade). Currently, all important, non-temporary channels are protected, and if they are deleted, the user who
            deleted it will be banned and admin chat will be notified. Also, whenever a role is deleted, admin chat is notified and the old role's members are saved
            in case the role needs to be restored via copying to a new role.
    polls:
        title: Polls
        body: >
            Commands in this module: `poll`, `open-poll`, `close-poll`, `poll-results`, `disclose`
    poll:
        title: Setup Poll
        body: |
            `{prefix}poll <channel> <type> <body> ;; <option> ;; <option> ...`

            Creates a new poll in the specified channel. `type` must be one of `normal`, `unique`, `commit`, `hidden`, `hidden_unique`, `hidden_commit`, or `show_on_commit`.

            `normal` - standard poll; users can add or remove votes to multiple options at any time
            `unique` - users can only choose exactly one option; choosing another one will swap their vote and remove the previous one
            `commit` - users can only choose exactly one option and cannot change it later
            `hidden` - standard poll like `normal`, but the poll message does not update to show the votes
            `hidden_unique` - `unique` + `hidden`
            `hidden_commit` - `commit` + `hidden`
            `show_on_commit` - `commit` + `hidden`, but when the user locks in their vote, they are shown the current vote distribution
        footer: Requires Admin
    open-poll:
        title: Open Poll
        body: >
            `{prefix}open-poll <message id>`


            Open up a poll to voting. Polls are open to voting when created, but may be closed via `{prefix}close-poll`
        footer: Requires Admin
    close-poll:
        title: Close Poll
        body: >
            `{prefix}close-poll <message id>`


            Close a poll by disabling all of the buttons on it. Polls can be reopened via `{prefix}open-poll`. Closing a poll does not do anything else like show results.
        footer: Requires Admin
    poll-results:
        title: Show Poll Results
        body: >
            `{prefix}poll-results <message id>`


            Display a poll's current votes.
        footer: Requires Admin
    disclose:
        title: Reveal Poll results
        body: >
            `{prefix}disclose <message id>`


            Edit a poll's results into the poll message. This command is not needed for normal polls as the editing is done automatically, only for hidden polls. Note
            that this action cannot be undone, and the results will not update automatically later if it is a hidden poll.
        footer: Requires Admin
    settings:
        title: Bot Settings
        body: >
            This module contains commands used to modify the bot's settings. There is no help text or command list for this as it is only used by the dev team.
        footer: Requires Bot Owner / Admin / Developer
    statschannels:
        title: Stats Channels
        body: >
            This server currently maintains two stats channels - <#927057269064085504> displays the overall member count and <#829803392447545404> displays the number
            of server boosters.
    sticky:
        title: Sticky Messages
        body: >
            Sticky messages do exactly what the name says - they stick to the bottom of the channel by deleting + re-sending each time. Note that sticky messages are
            quite annoying and disruptive, and should only be used when absolutely necessary.

            To add a sticky message, do `{prefix}stick <message>`. To remove a stick message, do `{prefix}stickstop`.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    stick:
        title: Add Sticky Message
        body: >
            `{prefix}stick <message>`


            If the current channel does not have a sticky message, set a new message to stay stuck to the bottom of a channel.
        footer: Requires Moderator
    stickstop:
        title: Remove Sticky Message
        body: >
            `{prefix}stickstop`


            Removes the current channel's sticky message if it has one.

    utility:
        title: Utility Commands
        body: >
            Useful commands for things like showing info or other uncategorized commands that don't belong to the `fun` module.

            Commands in this module: `ranks`, `reload-config`
    ranks:
        title: Show Ranks
        body: >
            `{prefix}ranks [member]`


            Show the ranks (not roles) for a member, or if not specified, youself. Ranks are internal permission categories.

        title: Reload Configuration File
        body: >
            `{prefix}reload-config`


            Reload `config.json`. Most things will be brought up-to-date by this command. This is only necessary if the file was edited manually, not if the
            configuration was modified via commands (unless otherwise specified).

    verification:
        title: CAPTCHA Verification System
        body: >
            This server uses Google reCAPTCHA to protect itself from raids and bot users. After reading the rules, unverified users have the option to press
            the button interaction which sends them an ephemeral message (only visible to them) containing a unique link that will verify them. Passing
            captcha verification will grant them <@&805458032929538061>, which grants them access to most of the rest of the server.


            `{prefix}post-verify <channel>` will create a new verification prompt but this command shouldn't really need to be used. Requires Bot Owner / Admin
            / Developer.

        body: >
            https://shenhemains.com - check out our website here! This website serves as the official page for this discord server. Credit goes to the dev and art
            teams for their work on this site and its assets, as well as many other staff members who provided feedback for it during development. This website
            also contains the staff application forms and a staff dashboard for things like modmail threads and viewing staff applications.
    welcome:
        title: Welcome System
        body: >
            New members are sent a welcome message in <#890252868135825408> prompting them to read the rules and verify themselves.
    modulehandler:
        title: Module Handler
        body: >
            The module handler connects all of the modules to the bot and handles the logic for dispatching commands and sending client events like deleted channels
            and button interactions. `{prefix}load <module>`, `{prefix}unload <module>`, and `{prefix}reload <module>` can be used to dynamically enable and disable
            commands within the module and reload the module if the code has been updated. This allows certain commands to be updated without affecting functionality
            of other commands or restarting the bot.
